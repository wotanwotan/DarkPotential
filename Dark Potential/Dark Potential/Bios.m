NSString* const DP_XLANTHOS_BIO = @"The X'Lanthos have mastered the technology of dark potential field manipulations, and the Assassin is a testament to that. \n\nUsing a Phase Field Generator, the Assassin can actually pass through walls, obstacles, and even other models to get to its intended prey. What is worse than this is that it possesses a personal cloaking field, a Dark Fusion powered item that manipulates electromagnetic fields to appear almost perfectly invisible. \n\nTo top this all off the Assassin wields duel Subatomic Destabilizing Blades, which use field manipulation to disrupt the molecular bond of whatever they pass through, ignoring the strongest armour to easily kill whatever the Assassin manages to get close to. \n\nWhere to buy models: \n\nhttp://store.miniwargaming.com/category/dark-potential-xlanthos/";

NSString* const DP_RECLAIMERS_BIO = @"When a member of the Reclaimer society wishes to join the ranks of the Reclaimer military, they start their careers as Initiates. However, even lowly Initiates are armed far better than most earth-bound humans, wielding Particle Rifles capable of two fire modes: regular high strength, or concentrated higher strength. \n\nEither way Initiates are the main issue for Reclamation units, though their low morale forces their commanders to keep a close eye on them, for fear that they will run from almost any threat. \n\nWhere to buy models: \n\nhttp://store.miniwargaming.com/category/dark-potential-reclaimers/";
