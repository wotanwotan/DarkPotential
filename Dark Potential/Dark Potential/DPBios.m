What is worse than this is that it possesses a personal cloaking field, a Dark Fusion powered item that manipulates electromagnetic fields to appear almost perfectly invisible. \n\nTo top this all off the Assassin wields duel Subatomic Destabilizing Blades, which use field manipulation to disrupt the molecular bond of whatever they pass through, ignoring the strongest armour to easily kill whatever the Assassin manages to get close to. \n\nFor more info: \n\nhttp://store.miniwargaming.com/category/dark-potential-xlanthos/";

However, even lowly Initiates are armed far better than most earth-bound humans, wielding Particle Rifles capable of two fire modes: regular high strength, or concentrated higher strength. \n\nEither way Initiates are the main issue for Reclamation units, though their low morale forces their commanders to keep a close eye on them, for fear that they will run from almost any threat. \n\nFor more info: \n\nhttp://store.miniwargaming.com/category/dark-potential-reclaimers/";

The Corporation Snipers are trained to do just that, trading heavier armour for mobility and the ability to better use cover to their advantage. Their high powered rifles are actually quite heavy, but this is offset by built in anti-gravity Dark Potential generators to help make it easier to deploy and stabilize the weapon. \n\nFor more info: \n\nhttp://www.darkpotential.com/miniatures/product.php?catid=1480&id=24586";
